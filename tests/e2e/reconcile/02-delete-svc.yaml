kind: TestStep
# Do not use a kuttl delete test step here:
# The delete test step will wait until the object is successfully deleted,
# however the operator will immediately re-create the object again.
# For local clusters this worked reliably (kuttl validation was faster than the operator
# re-creating the object), but it is flaky for remote clusters (higher latency).
commands:
- command: kubectl delete service tempo-simplest-querier
