  Previously, the operator assigned the `cluster-monitoring-view` ClusterRole to the Tempo Service Account
  when the Prometheus endpoint of the Jaeger UI Monitor tab is set to the Thanos Querier on OpenShift.

  With this change, the operator limits the granted permissions to only view metrics of the namespace of the Tempo instance.
  Additionally, the recommended port of the Thanos Querier service changed from `9091` to `9092` (tenancy-aware port):
  `.spec.template.queryFrontend.jaegerQuery.monitorTab.prometheusEndpoint: https://thanos-querier.openshift-monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9092`.

  All existing installations, which have the Thanos Querier configured at port 9091, will be upgraded automatically to use port 9092.
